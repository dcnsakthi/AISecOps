## Securing your machine learning (ML) model is essential to protect it from potential threats and ensure its integrity. 

Here are some best practices for securing ML models:

1. **Model Bias and Fairness:**
   - **Check for Bias:** Analyze your training data for bias related to gender, race, or other protected attributes. Mitigate bias during preprocessing.
   - **Fairness Metrics:** Evaluate model fairness using metrics like disparate impact, equalized odds, and demographic parity.

2. **Adversarial Attacks:**
   - **Adversarial Examples:** Test your model against adversarial examples (crafted to deceive the model). Implement defenses like adversarial training.
   - **Robustness Testing:** Assess model robustness by intentionally perturbing input data.
